## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
**User Profiles Management** is a responsive web application built using **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It allows users to **create, edit, delete, search, and manage user profiles** with persistent data stored in the browserâ€™s **localStorage** â€” all without requiring a backend server.

This project demonstrates front-end CRUD operations, state management using React hooks, and local persistence using browser storage.

##  How It Works---
1. On the first load, the app displays **sample profiles**.
2. All profile data is stored locally in the browser (`localStorage`).
3. You can:
   -  Add new profiles  
   -  Edit existing ones  
   -  Delete unwanted profiles  
   -  Search through the list  
4. Data updates instantly and persists even after reloading the page.
